# Overview
This project is an initial attempt to predict a March Madness bracket based solely on past tournament data.  Specifically, the odds of the top seed winning a game were calculated for every pair of seeds that have played each other in the last ten years.  These odds are the only only consideration when generating a bracket.  

The data used for these predictions was obtained from Kaggle.  It provides plenty of additional data is available to improve the predictions.  Here's the link to the data:
